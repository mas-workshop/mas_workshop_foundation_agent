            # The function call below is:
            # client.chat.completions.create(...)
            #
            # When Python reaches this line, the following happens in order:
            #
            # 1. Python collects the arguments passed to the function:
            #    - the model name
            #    - the messages list
            #    - the temperature value
            #
            # 2. Python sends these values over the network to Groq.
            #
            # 3. The messages argument is built using the + operator.
            #    The + operator joins two Python lists together:
            #
            #    a) The first list contains one item:
            #       {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}
            #
            #    b) The second list is st.session_state.messages,
            #       which already contains:
            #       - earlier user questions
            #       - earlier Groq responses
            #       - plus the new user question added above
            #
            # 4. Because these two lists are joined together,
            #    ALL earlier questions and ALL earlier Groq responses
            #    are sent again to Groq along with the new question.
            #
            # 5. Groq processes the text it receives and sends back a reply.
            #
            # 6. Python waits until Groq responds.
            #
            # 7. Python stores Groq’s response in the variable named `completion`.
            #
            completion = client.chat.completions.create(
                model=model,
                messages=[
